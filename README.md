# Moodify
Moodify is a mood-based music recommender that suggests songs tailored to how the user feels. Users enter a mood, and the program maps it to specific genres before retrieving tracks using the Spotify API. It uses object-oriented design and external data integration to generate personalized playlists. This was a school project.
